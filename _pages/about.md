Hi, I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at <a href='https://luddy.indiana.edu/'>Indiana University Bloomington</a>. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href='https://mit.edu/'>MIT</a>, working with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0nJR75gAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Hermano Igo Krebs</a> on Smart Rehabilitation Robotics. I also served as an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href='https://www.purdue.edu/'>Purdue University</a>.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href='https://www.purdue.edu/'>Purdue University</a>, in the <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/'>Video and Image Processing Lab (VIPER)</a>, where I had the privilege of being advised by <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~zhu0/'>Prof. Fengqing Maggie Zhu</a> and <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/'>Prof. Edward Delp</a>.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the <a href='https://en.uestc.edu.cn/'>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a>, Chengdu.

<i>I warmly welcome anyone interested in collaborating or discussing research with me, whether remotely or in person. Potential topics related to **continual learning**, **long-tail learning**, and **AI for health care**.</i>

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am seeking highly motivated Ph.D students. Please email me your CV if you are interested. Make sure to indicate whether you are applying for PhD or the Research Intern in your email title.</span>
