Hi, I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at <a href='https://www.mit.edu/'>MIT</a>. Additionally, I serve as an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href='https://www.purdue.edu/'>Purdue University</a>.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href='https://www.purdue.edu/'>Purdue University</a>, in the <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/'>Video and Image Processing Lab (VIPER)</a>, where I had the privilege of being advised by <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~zhu0/'>Prof. Fengqing Maggie Zhu</a> and <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/'>Prof. Edward Delp</a>.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the <a href='https://en.uestc.edu.cn/'>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a>, Chengdu.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
