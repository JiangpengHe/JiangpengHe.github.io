Hi, I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at <a href='https://www.mit.edu/'>MIT</a>. Additionally, I serve as an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href='https://www.purdue.edu/'>Purdue University</a>.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href='https://www.purdue.edu/'>Purdue University</a>, in the <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/'>Video and Image Processing Lab (VIPER)</a>, where I had the privilege of being advised by <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~zhu0/'>Prof. Fengqing Maggie Zhu</a> and <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/'>Prof. Edward Delp</a>.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the <a href='https://en.uestc.edu.cn/'>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a>, Chengdu.

<i>I warmly welcome anyone interested in collaborating or discussing research with me, whether remotely or in person. Potential topics related to **continual learning**, **long-tail learning**, and **AI for health care**.</i>
