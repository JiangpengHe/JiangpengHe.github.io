ECE30100 Signals and Systems

I had the privilege to serve as the graduate instructor for ECE30100 Signals and Systems at Purdue University, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Summer 2022.

This course catered to a diverse group of talented undergraduate students from fields including computer engineering, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering. Signals and Systems stands as one of the core and fundamental courses in the realms of communication, network, signal, and image processing.

Overseeing a class of 84 students with the 3 teaching assistants was both a rewarding and challenging experience. My responsibilities encompassed:

- Developing course material
- Leading teaching sessions
- Hosting office hours
- Supervising teaching assistants

Topics Covered:

- Introduction to signals/systems and properties
- Fourier series representation for CT/DT periodic signals
- CTFT for aperiodic/periodic signals
- Convolution property and amplitude modulation
- DTFT for aperiodic/periodic signals
- Sampling theory
