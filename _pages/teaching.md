ECE30100 Signals and Systems

I had the privilege to serve as the graduate instructor for ECE30100 Signals and Systems at Purdue University, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Summer 2022.

This course catered to a diverse group of talented undergraduate students from fields including computer engineering, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering. Signals and Systems stands as one of the core and fundamental courses in the realms of communication, network, signal, and image processing.
