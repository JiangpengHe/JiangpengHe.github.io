Our paper **Long-Tailed Continual Learning For Visual Food Recognition** is accepted to [IEEE Transactions on Multimedia](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6046). We introduced new food image benchmark datasets **VFN186** that simulates the real-world food consumption patterns for healthy people, type-1 and type-2 diabetes to perform continual learning. The paper and dataset can be accessed [Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00183).
